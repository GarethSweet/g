AHM's combined extras limit is the most versatile health insurance product on the market. Rather than attempt to cater to the "average person", it recognises that everyone has distinct, individual, ever changing requirements. Policies that do this… policies that average out the requirements of everyone, ultimately really serve no one. So, how do we educate people that the average customer does not exist, and get them to switch to AHM?

## Solution

We created “Average Me”… an App that uses state of the art facial recognition technology to see what the average of you and your Facebook friends looks like. The resulting image is a combination of features created from the average mouth, nose, hair, eye and face size and shapes of you and your friends.

## Results

* Over 100,000 campaign visits in 2 months.
* More than 20,000 onward visits to ahm.com.au, creating the highest ever traffic levels for the site.
* Highest sales period in the last 10 months.
