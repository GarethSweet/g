While it’s well established that people with diabetes are more prone to gum disease, new research suggests that chronic gum disease may also increase your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

Gum disease is a bacterial infection and can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream and activate the cells in your pancreas that are responsible for regulating blood sugar, or insulin, levels. This in turn may trigger the development of Type 2, or adult onset, diabetes — even in individuals who are otherwise very healthy. If you develop diabetes existing gum disease may exacerbate your condition as it tends to cause blood sugar levels to rise and be less easily controlled.

Other oral health issues that may influence your susceptibility to and ability to control diabetes include:

* Thrush, an infection caused by fungus that grows in your mouth
* Dry mouth, this condition also can lead to soreness, mouth ulcers, infections and cavities

If you already have diabetes be sure to inform your dentist and keep them apprised of any changes in your condition. They should advise you to postpone any non-emergency dental procedures you require if your blood sugar is not in good control.

On a daily basis it is important for diabetic individuals to avoid smoking and other tobacco use, and to follow the basic principles of oral care:

* Adults should brush their teeth, tongue and gums twice daily using a fluoride toothpaste and drink water that contains fluoride. If your gum disease causes you sensitivity pain, you may also want to consider using a toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth and gums
* Be sure to remove plaque at and below your gums by flossing every day
* For good measure, you may also want to consider rinsing with a mouthwash 
* Schedule regular, six-monthly visits with your dentist to monitor your oral health and to look for early signs of tooth decay or gum disease that can be reversed

If you don’t have diabetes, but you are battling gum disease, see your doctor regularly and inform them of any unusual symptoms you may experience.
