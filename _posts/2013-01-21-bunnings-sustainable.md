With more and more focus in the media on the issue of global warming, an increasing number of people are starting to look for ways they can contribute to the well-being of the planet.One idea that’s gaining increasing interest is that of sustainable gardening. That is, gardening that minimises harm to the earth and its inhabitants, while maximising the benefits. Here's how you can get started.**Water**•	Wherever possible try to capture rainwater and grey water for use in the garden •	Avoid the use of sprinklers, instead try to water directly onto root zones by hand or using soaker or drip irrigation, preferably in the morning •	Group plants with similar water needs•	Weed regularly, because weeds compete for water**Compost, Mulch and Worm Farms**•	Make your own compost for use in the garden using yard clippings and kitchen scraps•	Consider setting up a worm farm•	Composting, mulching and worm castings improve soil conditioning and increase water retention thus increasing productivity and reducing the need to water•	Mulching also helps with weed control **Types of Plants**•	Where possible use plants that are native to your area - they will have a better chance of survival, need less upkeep, and attract native animals**Fertilisers**•	Use natural fertilisers such as compost, cow or chicken manure, rock phosphate, kelp, seaweed, fish meal etc.**Pest & Disease Control**•	Select pest resistant plants and ensure good air circulation•	Use companion planting to confuse or repel pests•	Always try the least toxic treatment first then work your way up from there•	Avoid broad spectrum insecticides•	Weed by hand wherever possible**Lawn**•	Limit the size of your lawn•	Use a human powered lawn mower•	Consider native ground cover as an alternative**Recycle & Re-use**•	Re-use plastic plant pots•	Propagate your own plants from seed, cuttings or by dividing existing plants•	Repair and recycle garden furniture rather than throwing it away•	Re-use excess timber and building supplies to make planters, sheds, benches, garden furniture etc.
