Every tooth in your mouth has a specific function, as does every part of each tooth. A healthy mouth will have eight sharp, chisel-shaped incisors up front to assist in cutting food, as well as four pointed canines, or cuspids, for tearing food. Premolars are for crushing and tearing and appear along the middle of your cheek, while molars exist in the far back of your mouth and assist in grinding or chewing food.

What we’ve just described, and what you are able to see of your teeth in your mouth, is the crown of your tooth. But the crown just one part of the sophisticated system that is your mouth, including:

* Gum line: This is where your teeth and gums meet. Without proper brushing and flossing, plaque and tartar can build up at and just below the gum line, leading to gingivitis and gum disease.
* Root: This is the part of your teeth that is embedded in bone. The root makes up about two-thirds of a tooth and holds it in place.
* Enamel: This is the outermost layer of your teeth. Enamel is the strongest and most mineralized tissue in your body, yet it is damaged and eroded daily by the acids in plaque. Fluoride helps to re-mineralise tooth enamel, but if you allow plaque and tartar to build up on your teeth, enamel erosion will lead to tooth decay.
* Dentin: This is the layer of tooth that exists just under the enamel. If tooth decay is allowed to progress its way through the enamel, it will next attack the dentin. Millions of tiny holes, or tubules, exist in the dentin and lead directly to the centre of your teeth where nerve endings exist. If your dentin is exposed, you will likely have highly sensitive teeth and experience pain when consuming hot and cold liquids.
* Pulp: This is the area in the centre of your teeth where blood vessels and nerve endings exist. If tooth decay reaches the pulp, you usually feel significant pain, and this is generally when root canal treatment is necessary.

So how and when do these features appear in your mouth? Your baby teeth play an important role in the development of your permanent teeth, as they hold a space for them and guide their positioning and alignment. When permanent teeth are ready to erupt, or grow through your gum tissues, the roots in your baby teeth dissolve and allow them to fall out. 

Baby incisors generally appear within the first six months, while their permanent replacements are already developing below the gum line. Between ages 1 and 2, baby molars begin to emerge.

Age 6 usually marks the emergence of the first permanent teeth, and these are known as the six-year molars. They’re at the very back of your mouth, and because they don’t cause any baby teeth to fall out, they’re often mistaken for baby teeth.

Even after permanent teeth have erupted, their roots continue developing through age 10. Dental injuries incurred between ages 6 and 9 can halt this root growth and lead to tooth loss or discolouration. 

By age 13 or so, all permanent teeth should be present and accounted for. Since some may erupt at an angle, this is generally the age when children need to get braces or other orthodontic treatment. Remember that braces and other orthodontic treatment are relevant at every age, and adults are increasingly taking advantage of clear braces and aligners to correct their crooked or misaligned teeth.

As you continue to grow into your late teens, your wisdom teeth may or may not erupt, and your dentist will determine whether they need to be extracted or whether they’re safe to keep.

If you have questions about the anatomy of your teeth, or if you believe that yours or your child’s teeth are not growing normally, schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible.
