## Problem ##

Promote Westfield Shopping Centre’s new in-store stylist service.
			
## Solution ##
			
The fashion industry is often accused of creating unrealistic images of the female body.We wanted to change this and instead spearhead a fashion-led movement that sought to empower women by helping them focus on their strengths rather than their flaws.To counter this we wanted to spearhead a fashion-led movement that, using Westfield’s stylists, would educate women and help them to embrace their strengths rather than focus on their flaws.So they could say with confidence: I Like Me.

## How It Works ##
			
To kick the movement off and to prove that, with the help of Westfield Stylists everyday women have the potential to look terrific we hold an event:I like me September.We ask Australia’s leading women’s fashion magazines to feature an image of a real, everyday Australian woman free of any digital alteration, styled by the team of Westfield Stylists, on the front cover of their September issue.These women, unenhanced by retouching, botox or collagen, then become the models for our season and an inspiration to other women across the country.Our goal is to encourage all Australian women to say I Like Me.The women would be selected via a Facebook promotion (‘Like’ is Facebook language after all) that asks everyday women to nominate a female friend or family member who they think would benefit from a confidence boost.This would be supported by in-centre and on-line activity plus an interactive video.The team of Westfield Stylists would then select several of the women to become the faces of I Like Me September.The selected women would each be paired with a famous Australian fashion photographer and styled by a Westfield Stylist. In this way we show women that by embracing the good, and not so good, bits of your body shape it is possible to look (and feel) amazing.I Like Me September would be launched with a red carpet media event at Westfield, to which Facebook fans would have the chance to win tickets. It would also tie into the Federal Government’s Positive Body Image Awards initiative.The launch would be supported with the release of content on Westfield’s YouTube page - Style TV and their Facebook page featuring webisodes following our models and stylists through the selection process, their personal styling journey and the shoots.
