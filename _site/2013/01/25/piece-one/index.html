		<p>While looking at Google Analytics for this site, I started noticing some unknown page titles. It was immediately obvious that a few people had taken the source from GitHub and started using it with their own content.</p>

<p>It took me a significant amount of time to get Jekyll <em>functioning</em> exactly as I wanted it to. The reason for putting the source on GitHub&#8212;other than to host it on GitHub Pages&#8212;was so that people could peep the code, and to learn how to use Jekyll, just as I had done.</p>

<p>However, I never intended the <em>design</em> to be reused. The <a href='http://andytaylor.me/v3/'>last iteration of this site</a> was ripped off. It wasn&#8217;t on GitHub, but it was a 100% static site, so the source was available with any browser. There&#8217;s a general understanding in the web community that stealing design is wrong; there was no doubt that this was a ripoff.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>

<p>But when the source is on GitHub, I can somewhat see the other side of the argument: &#8216;it&#8217;s on GitHub, that means I can take it and do with it what I please&#8217;. But I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s right. Just because it&#8217;s there for you to see, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s there for you to use entirely as you wish. That&#8217;s why many repositories contain licenses.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s <em>right</em>, but I can see the grey area.</p>

<p>I should&#8217;ve stripped out the design and open sourced it as a sandbox/boilerplate. I should&#8217;ve included a licence.<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> I shouldn&#8217;t of assumed that people wouldn&#8217;t take it in its entirety. It is now a private repository.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear people&#8217;s opinions on this. Hit me up on <a href='http://twitter.com/andytlr'>Twitter</a> or <a href='mailto:hi@andytaylor.me'>&#104;&#105;&#064;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#121;&#116;&#097;&#121;&#108;&#111;&#114;&#046;&#109;&#101;</a>.</p>
<div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>
<p>There was lively debate about this on both Twitter and Dribbble. All of which have disappeared from the internet. However, I still have <code>.webarchive</code>&#8217;s.</p>
<a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'>
<p>I wonder if this would&#8217;ve made a difference.</p>
