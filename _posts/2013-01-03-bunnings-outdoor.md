Whether you’re flying solo with a coffee and a good book, or hosting a barbecue for friends and family, summer is the perfect time of year to get out and enjoy your back garden.

But with the harsh UV rays of the Australian sun, to make the most of it, you really need to ensure you have enough shade. Not only will this create a natural area for people to gather, it can reduce the temperature in your garden by up to 10 degrees.

## Things to consider ##

The first thing to look at is how the sun moves through your garden. The sun will shine hottest on your western boundary – so it pays to ensure this is well protected, as it will absorb the majority of heat into your home.

You should also work out how much shade your garden needs:

* In arid, Mediterranean climates with long hot summers, 75% of your garden should be in shade
* In variable climates with warm summers and chilly winters, 50% of your garden should be in shade
* Tropical gardens in more humid climates will benefit from 80% shade

## Trees ##

The cheapest way to create shade in your garden is with trees. They also have the added benefit of helping the environment.

Deciduous trees (that drop their leaves in winter) provide good shade in summer with the added benefit of allowing sunlight into the garden in winter.

It’s important to look at the size of the tree to ensure that it will be right for your garden. Ideally whatever you choose should have a broad canopy and horizontal branching to ensure that it produces the most usable shade.

On boundaries, upright trees can be used to enhance privacy as well as providing shade.

Small trees and shrubs can also be planted to shade windows, further helping to keep your home cool.

## Pergolas & Outdoor Rooms ##

For something a little more permanent you could opt for a pergola or even an outdoor room. These can be as simple or as luxurious as you like and can add real appeal to your backyard – not to mention value to your home. 

Pergolas are easy to build and can be enhanced by training climbing plants over them such as grape, star jasmine and Virginia creeper.

Bear in mind that roofed structures and modern outdoor pavilions will require planning permits. However these have the added benefit of providing a usable outdoor space even when it rains.

## Shade Sails ##

Suspended shade sails can provide an affordable and stylish alternative to a pergola – being almost as much of an architectural design feature as they are a practical shade solution.

Made from either shade cloth or PVC they’re relatively easy to install and can be removed in winter and replaced in summer.

Because they can be affixed in different ways there’s almost no end to the variety of interesting shapes they can create.

## Pop-Up Gazebo Canopy ##

Usually rectangular or square in shape, these pop-up canopies of stretched fabric supported by vertical poles provide lots of shade, and even protection from light rain if the weather turns nasty.

And because they pack down quite small, they’re easy to store when not in use.

## Umbrellas ##

Perfect for shading smaller areas, they’re also great because they can be moved to optimise shade throughout the day.

They come in a variety of colours, sizes and styles. Some are freestanding, while others are designed to fit into a patio table with a hole in the centre. 

However, regardless of the type you have, make sure to secure the bottom firmly to ensure it doesn’t blow down in a sudden gust of wind.
