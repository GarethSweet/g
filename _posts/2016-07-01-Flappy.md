### The problem ###

How do you get Australian businesses to engage online with a brand most people think, thanks to Google, is now redundant?

### The solution ###

Believe it or not, White Pages are really pretty good at what they do – getting businesses found. So we showed what our success has meant to something else businesses rely on to help their customers find them – the humble Flappy Man. We created a six part online content series around Flappy Man. Starting with his glory days, it then followed his fall from grace after he loses his job thanks to White Pages and then our efforts to help him find a new one.Using Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn we reached out to Australian businesses and asked them to help us help Flappy Man find a job. We then selected the three best entries from around Australia and filmed him trying out as a barman, a nail technician and a surf instructor.

### Results ###

People loved him. Over the three week campaign period with minimal media spend we:•	Reached almost 800,000 people•	Exceeded organic reach targets by 625% thanks to shares and re-posts
