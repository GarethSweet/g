As the weather turns and the thermometer begins to drop, we all start to think about how we can prepare our homes and ourselves for the coming winter months. With a little forethought, you can ensure you stay safe, snug and dry, and save on some energy bills while you’re at it.

## Draft Proofing ##

Drafts in your home can account for up to 25% of heat loss in winter. But the good news is that fixing them is inexpensive and easily done yourself. Here’s what to look for:

* Ensure all openings for skylights, pipes and ductwork are well sealed
* Look for gaps between floorboards
* Check for air leaks around the edges of doors and flooring (a good way to do this is using a lit candle)
* Check exterior doors and windows – if they rattle or you can see daylight around the edges they will leak air
* Seal off unused fireplaces
* Check for cracks or holes in your home’s foundations

The best way to tackle most gaps and cracks is with a caulking gun. Adhesive weather strips are also useful around doors and windows. For the gaps between doors and floors you can attach draft sweeps to the bottom of the door or simply use a good old-fashioned draft excluder. 

## Insulation ##

Insulation will make the biggest difference to your home’s heating (and cooling) requirements by far, helping to reduce heat loss by up to 60%.

There are many different types of insulation, but the energy efficiency of all of them is measured using an R rating scale. The higher the number, the more efficient it will be, and therefore the greater the energy savings.

Here are a few tips to help you get the best performance from your insulation:

* Don’t compress bulk insulation
* Ensure the corners of ceilings, walls and floors are properly covered – that’s where most heat leaks occur
* Avoid any gaps – if even only 5% is left uncovered up to 50% of the benefit may be lost

When installing insulation, you should also take these safety matters into consideration:

* Have your wiring inspected by a licensed electrician to ensure it can be covered with insulation
* Don’t install insulation within 90mm of hot flues or exhaust fans
* Leave a 200mm gap around recessed light fittings and install downlight covers

## Outdoors ##

Winter can be a punishing time for your house so it pays to spend a little time giving the exterior a simple once over to ensure any obvious problems are taken care of before they become major issues. We suggest:

* Checking the condition of your roofing – looking for cracked and broken tiles and rusted or loose roof sheeting
* Clear gutters and downpipes of leaves and other debris to ensure that they’re flowing freely – you may even want to consider installing gutter mesh to reduce the problem in future
* Cut back any tree branches overhanging the house or which look old and diseased
* Check fencing for signs of weakness and age
* Make sure loose outdoor items such as umbrellas, chairs, picnic tables, barbecues etc. are safely secured and out of the elements
