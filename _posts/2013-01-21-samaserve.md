### The problem ###

As a major sponsor of The Australian Open, ANZ wanted something new and innovative to boost footfall in their corporate area and generate free publicity, a big ask considering people go to The Open to watch the tennis, not to visit a bank.

### The solution

ANZ gave tennis fans a once in a lifetime opportunity - the chance to play one-on-one against Australia’s top ranked player -- Sam Stosur.

Using Sam, we shot and created a live action 3D tennis game that was played on a specially built indoor tennis court inside the corporate area.

### How it worked ###

When the player stepped up, the game used face-tracking technology to personalise both a greeting from Sam and the game difficulty, based on whether they were a man, a woman or a child.

Players were given three serves each against Sam using a specially constructed tennis racquet that measured the speed and direction of their serve.

Based on this information, a shot would be played to Sam. The shots included several acing Sam, Sam hitting into the net, various forehand and backhand returns, and even special trick shots.

After each serve, Sam would comment on the shot played.

Then, after the three serves, based on how well they’d played, she’d give her opinion on the player’s overall performance. In all, the game contained more than 14,000 unique player experiences.
