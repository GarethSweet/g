## Problem ##

Traveller.com.au was a new site launched by Fairfax Media to give prospective travellers inspiration on destinations combined with real feedback from real people. Battling an already crowded market, we needed to encourage people to explore the site and engage with its content too.

### The solution ###

We created The Travel Bug, a quirky character that hung around the Traveller office. Visitors to the site needed to find him hidden in images throughout the pages of Traveller.com.au. Once found and clicked people go into a draw for daily prizes and a grand prize - an all expenses paid trip to India for two people. We cast the Travel Bug, shot content and created all of the campaign assets for less than AUD$15,000.

### Results ###

Travel Bug activity generated 159,295 page views and 46,433 visits across traveller.com.au. Over the duration of the competition, Traveller.com.au page views were higher than the 4 weeks prior (200%).
 The promotion received over 15,000 entries in 3 weeks and Travel Bug videos were viewed a total of 572,659 times across Facebook, YouTube and programmatic. 

The Traveller Facebook page grew by over 5,000 likes over the duration of the competition (3 weeks). And people shared the campaign over 8,000 times via Facebook, Twitter and email. 

It was the most successful digital campaign Fairfax had created up until that time.
